## pihole-blocklists
Blocklists for [pihole](https://pi-hole.net)

To install a blocklist:
Got to WebUI -> Group Management -> Adlists

### Microsoft Telemetry
To disallow Microsoft tleemtry to be collected from your Windows Clients (and Servers probably too) you can you the following URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabianseelbach/pihole-blocklists/production/microsoft-telemetry.txt

Those are listed in this [Document](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Cyber-Sicherheit/SiSyPHus/Analyse_Telemetriekomponente_1_0.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).

There may be more, but those are the domains referenced by BSI.
If you find more, please open an issue.


## Support

I do not support pi-hole, neither Windows.

I do not gurantee that this is working and that it is safe to do.
